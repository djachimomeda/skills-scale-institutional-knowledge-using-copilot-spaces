# UX Design Handoff Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures smooth handoff from UX Designers to Developers, reducing ambiguity and ensuring design intent is preserved during implementation.

## Pre-design Phase
- [ ] Problem statement and user needs documented
- [ ] Success metrics defined with Product Manager
- [ ] Technical constraints reviewed with Developers
- [ ] Research findings shared with team
- [ ] Design scope aligned with sprint capacity

## Design Artifacts
- [ ] User flows and journey maps completed
- [ ] Wireframes created and reviewed
- [ ] High-fidelity mockups finalized
- [ ] Prototype available (if applicable)
- [ ] Mobile and responsive breakpoints designed
- [ ] Accessibility considerations documented (WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Design specs annotated with measurements and spacing

## Design System & Components
- [ ] Components use existing design system elements
- [ ] New components documented in design system
- [ ] Component states defined (hover, active, disabled, error, loading)
- [ ] Color palette and typography specified
- [ ] Icons and illustrations provided in required formats

## Assets & Resources
- [ ] All images exported in required formats and resolutions
- [ ] Icons provided as SVG or appropriate format
- [ ] Fonts specified and available to developers
- [ ] Brand assets and logos included
- [ ] Asset naming convention followed

## Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- [ ] Interaction patterns documented
- [ ] Animation and transition specs provided (duration, easing)
- [ ] Form validation rules defined
- [ ] Error states and messaging documented
- [ ] Loading states specified
- [ ] Empty states designed
- [ ] Success/confirmation states included

## Content & Copy
- [ ] All copy finalized and approved
- [ ] Placeholder text identified (if any)
- [ ] Microcopy for buttons, labels, and tooltips provided
- [ ] Error messages written
- [ ] Character limits specified for input fields

## Developer Handoff Meeting
- [ ] Schedule handoff meeting with development team
- [ ] Walk through user flows and interactions
- [ ] Review technical feasibility and implementation approach
- [ ] Clarify any ambiguous design decisions
- [ ] Discuss edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Answer developer questions
- [ ] Share design file access (Figma, Sketch, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria & Testing
- [ ] Visual acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Key user interactions documented for testing
- [ ] Browser and device compatibility requirements specified
- [ ] Accessibility testing criteria included
- [ ] Usability testing plan prepared (if applicable)

## Documentation
- [ ] Design rationale documented
- [ ] User research insights summarized
- [ ] Assumptions and constraints noted
- [ ] Links to design files shared in project board/issue
- [ ] Design decisions logged for future reference

## Cross-role Collaboration
- [ ] Product Manager: Design aligns with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Developers: Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Scrum Master: Design ready for sprint planning
- [ ] QA/Testers: Acceptance criteria clear for validation
- [ ] Stakeholders: Design approved before handoff

## Post-handoff Support
- [ ] Available for developer questions during implementation
- [ ] Scheduled check-ins for in-progress work review
- [ ] Review pull requests for visual accuracy
- [ ] Participate in QA review before release
- [ ] Validate final implementation matches design intent
- [ ] Capture learnings for design system improvements

## Key Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Design files (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD links)
- [ ] Exported assets (images, icons, fonts)
- [ ] Annotated specs (spacing, colors, typography)
- [ ] User flows and interaction documentation
- [ ] Prototype or demo (if applicable)
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Responsive design breakpoints
- [ ] Component specifications

## Success Indicators
- Developers can implement without significant design questions
- Visual implementation matches design intent
- Accessibility requirements met
- User experience is intuitive and validated
- Design handoff does not block sprint progress
