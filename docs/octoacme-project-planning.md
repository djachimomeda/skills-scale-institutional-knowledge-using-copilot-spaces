# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Ensure UX Designer has time for research and design ahead of implementation
8. Coordinate with DevOps Engineer on infrastructure and deployment requirements

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length (typically facilitated by Scrum Master)
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- Confirm design artifacts are ready (coordinate with UX Designer)
- Verify technical dependencies and infrastructure readiness (coordinate with DevOps Engineer)

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
